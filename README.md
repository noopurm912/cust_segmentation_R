# Customer Segmentation using RFM analysis and K-means clustering algorithm

This project aims to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis and K-means clustering algorithm.


<h4>Data Source</h4>
The dataset is available on the website of the UCI machine learning repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00502/ (Chen, n.d.). The data is collected by Dr. Daqing Chen, School of Engineering, London South Bank University. The data set contains the sales transactions for two years 2009 and 2011 for the UK-based online retail all-occasion gift store. The data set from 01/12/2010 to 9/12/2011 is used to implement the project. The data has 541909 observations(rows) and 8 variables(columns). 


 <h4>Architecture & Implementation</h4>
  
The RFM(Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis and K-means clustering algorithm are used to perform customer segmentation. The objective of the implementation is to segment the customer by combining the RFM and K-means techniques to get useful insights from their respective results. The project implementation steps are as follows:  
•	Read the dataset
•	Data Preprocessing and visualization
•	Calculate RFM scores, values for each customer, and manually segment the customers based on the RFM scores.
•	Implement K-means clustering using RFM values as variables.
•	Analyze and compare the K-means clusters and segments from RFM analysis.
